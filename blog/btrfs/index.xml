      <description>The btrfs inspect-internal logical-resolve command is used to find a file related to a logical-address. This can be useful when btrfs reports a corruption at an specific logical address, making it easy for the user to find the corrupted file. But, for all current users of openSUSE/SUSE Enterprise Linux, this command was failing as shown below:
btrfs inspect-internal logical-resolve 5085913088 / ERROR: cannot access &#39;//@/home&#39;: No such file or directory An openSUSE/SLE intallation would create a set of subvolumes, starting from /@.</description>

      <description>The send/receive is a feature from btrfs where you can generate a stream of changes between two snapshots and then apply to any btrfs system, being a different disk on the host or over the network.
The receive feature receives a stream of data, applying the it in the filesystem. As the stream can be a file, it&amp;rsquo;s easy even to transfer the output of send over the network and receive in the other side.</description>

      <description>Note: The kernel changes mentioned here should appear in Linux 5.6 since it&amp;rsquo;s currently in linux-next, and the patches related to btrfs-progs and xfstests are still waiting to be merged
btrfs is a very versatile filesystem, and it has a lot of features that don&amp;rsquo;t exist in any other mainline Linux filesystem. One of the key features of btrfs is the concept of subvolumes. A subvolume can be compared to a disk partition since each subvolume can contain it&amp;rsquo;s own filesystem tree and size limits.</description>
