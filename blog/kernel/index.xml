      <description>After chasing the problem of rotational sysfs property of USB flash drives, I started to check another sysfs attributes of USB storage devices, and I noted two missing attributes: vpd_pg80 and vpd_pg83.
As explained here, VPD pages contain data related to the device. In special, page 80 is Unit Serial Number (sn) and page 83 is Device Information (di), which are present in any SCSI device that complies with SPC-2 or later.</description>

      <title>Kernel Adventures: Are USB Sticks Rotational Devices?</title>

      <description>A while ago I’ve found this kernel bug entry about USB mass storage being shown as a rotational device. This is wrong because a USB stick is a flash device, and does not rotate.
About rotational devices Let’s take a minute to discuss about the evolution from disk to flash storage.
Older storage devices, HDD in this example, were called Disk Storage because these devices recorded data into one or more rotating disks.</description>
