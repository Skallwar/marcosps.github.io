      <description>The send/receive is a feature from btrfs where you can generate a stream of changes between two snapshots and then apply to any btrfs system, being a different disk on the host or over the network.
The receive feature receives a stream of data, applying the it in the filesystem. As the stream can be a file, it&amp;rsquo;s easy even to transfer the output of send over the network and receive in the other side.</description>
