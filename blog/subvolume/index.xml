      <description>The btrfs inspect-internal logical-resolve command is used to find a file related to a logical-address. This can be useful when btrfs reports a corruption at an specific logical address, making it easy for the user to find the corrupted file. But, for all current users of openSUSE/SUSE Enterprise Linux, this command was failing as shown below:
btrfs inspect-internal logical-resolve 5085913088 / ERROR: cannot access &#39;//@/home&#39;: No such file or directory An openSUSE/SLE installation would create a set of subvolumes, starting from /@.</description>

      <description>Note: The kernel changes mentioned here should appear in Linux 5.6 since it&amp;rsquo;s currently in linux-next, and the patches related to btrfs-progs and xfstests are still waiting to be merged
btrfs is a very versatile filesystem, and it has a lot of features that don&amp;rsquo;t exist in any other mainline Linux filesystem. One of the key features of btrfs is the concept of subvolumes. A subvolume can be compared to a disk partition since each subvolume can contain it&amp;rsquo;s own filesystem tree and size limits.</description>
