Hi, I am Marcos

I am a software developer focused on Linux and open source. I had the pleasure to contribute to some very nice open source projects, like Linux kernel, libvirt, LibreOffice, btrfs, among others.

Here I will share some issues that I had to fix and/or understand, and share the knowledge that I aquired in the process.
